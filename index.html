    <h2 id="ques">Q1. What is the Difference between react and react native? Which one is library or framework ?</h2>
    <h3>Ans- Differences-</h3>
    <h3><ul>
      <li>
        Reactjs can be described as a base derivative of React DOM, for the web
        platform while React Native is a base derivative in itself, which means
        that the syntax and workflow remain the same, but components alter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reactjs, eventually, is a JavaScript library, which enables the
        programmer to create an engaging and high performing UI Layer while
        React Native is an entire framework for building cross-platform apps, be
        it web, iOS or Android.
      </li>
      <li>
        In Reactjs, virtual DOM is used to render browser code in Reactjs while
        in React Native, native APIs are used to render components in mobile.
      </li>
      <li>
        The apps developed with Reactjs renders HTML in UI while React Native
        uses JSX for rendering UI, which is nothing but javascript.
      </li>
      <li>
        CSS is used for creating styling in Reactjs while a stylesheet is used
        for styling in React Native.
      </li>
      <li>
        In Reactjs, the animation is possible, using CSS, just like web
        development while in React Native, an animated API is used for inducing
        animation across different components of the React Native application.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the need is to build a high performing, dynamic, and responsive UI
        for web interfaces, then Reactjs is the best option while if the need is
        to give mobile apps a truly native feeling, then React Native is the
        best option.
      </li>
    </ul></h3>
    <h2>
      <ul>
        <p>React Advantages-</p>
        <li>Blazing Speed with DOM</li>
        <li>Component-Based Architecture Saves Time</li>
        <li>Reactjs Gives Powerboost To SEO</li>
        <li>Huge Ecosystem Of Developer Tools</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p>React Native Advantages-</p>
        <li>Advantage Platform-specific Code</li>
        <li>
          Even a Front-End Web Developer Can Create App Using React Native
        </li>
        <li>Development Takes Less Time Due To Hot Reloading feature</li>
        <li>Ready-to-use UI libraries for smoother UI experience</li>

    <h2 id="ques">Q2. What is the package name you are using for routing ?</h2>
    <h2>Ans- React Router includes three main packages:</h2>
    <h3><ul>
      <li><pre>react-router, the core package for the router</pre></li>
      <li>
        <pre>
react-router-dom, which contains the DOM bindings for React Router. In other words, the router components for websites</pre
        >
        <p>
          In other words, you don’t need to use React Router and React Router
          DOM together. If you find yourself using both, it’s OK to get rid of
          React Router since you already have it installed as a dependency
          within React Router DOM.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, however, that React Router DOM is only available on the browser,
          so you can only use it for web applications.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <pre>
react-router-native, which contains the React Native bindings for React Router. In other words, the router components for an app development environment using React Native</pre
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>"react-router-dom": "^6.4.1"</pre></h3>
    <h2>
      React Router DOM enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app.
      Unlike the traditional routing architecture in which the routing is
      handled in a configuration outside of a running app, React Router DOM
      facilitates component-based routing according to the needs of the app and
      platform.
    </h2>
    <h2>Installation command:</h2>
    <pre>npm install react-router-dom</pre>

    <h2 id="ques">Q4. How do you pass data from parent to child ?</h2>
    <h2>
      Ans- When you need to pass data from a parent to child class component,
      you do this by using props.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      For example, let’s say you have two class components, Parent and Child,
      and you want to pass a state in the parent to the child. You would do
      something like this:
    </h2>
    <pre>
        import React from 'react';

class Parent extends React.Component{
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            data: 'Data from parent'
        }
    }

    render(){
        const {data} = this.state;
        return(
            <div>
                <Child dataParentToChild = {data}/>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

class Child extends React.Component{
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            data: this.props.dataParentToChild
        }
    }

    render(){
        const {data} = this.state;
        return(
            <div>
                {data}
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default Parent;
    </pre>
    <h3>As you can see, the parent component passes props to the child component and the child can then access the data from the parent via this.props.</h3>
    <h2>For the same example, if you have two function components instead of class components, you don’t even need to use props. You can do something like the following:</h2>
    <pre>
        import React from 'react';

function Parent(){
    const data = 'Data from parent';
    return(
        <div>
            <Child dataParentToChild = {data}/>
        </div>
    )
}

function Child ({dataParentToChild}){
    return(
        <div>
            {dataParentToChild}
        </div>
    )
}

export default Parent;

    <h2 id="ques">Q5. What is lazy loading in react ?</h2>
    <h2>Ans- As the name suggests, lazy loading is an optimization technique or a design pattern in which the loading of an item, whether it’s a picture, video, web page, music file, or document, is delayed until it is required, saving bandwidth and precious computing resources.</h2>
    <h2>The primary advantages of lazy loading are performance related:</h2>
    <h2><ul><li>Faster initial loading: By reducing the page weight, lazy loading a web page allows for a faster initial page load time.</li>
    <li>Less bandwidth consumption: Lazy-loaded images save data and bandwidth, particularly useful for individuals who don’t have fast internet or large data plans.</li>
    <li>Preserving system resources: Lazy loading conserves server and client resources by requesting just a fraction of components.</li>
    <li>Reduced work for the browser: When pictures are lazy-loaded, your browser does not need to process or decode them until they are requested by scrolling the page.</li></ul></h2>
    <h2><pre>React has two native features that make it really simple and easy to implement lazy loading—React.lazy() and React.Suspense.</pre></h2>

    <h2 id="ques">Q6. Difference b/w Stateful and stateless Component.</h2>
    <h2>Ans- Stateful and stateless components have many different names.</h2>
    <h3>They are also known as:</h3>
    <h3><ul><li>Container vs Presentational components</li>
    <li>Smart vs Dumb components</li></ul></h3>
    <h3>The literal difference is that one has state, and the other doesn’t. That means the stateful components are keeping track of changing data, while stateless components print out what is given to them via props, or they always render the same thing.</h3>
    <h3>Stateful component:</h3>
    <h3><ol><li>A component that manages the state in class-based with state or functional with useState.</li>
    <li>In some component, the data keeps changing, for example, watching the cricket score etc.</li>
    <li>In most of the cases, the class-based components extend react component.</li>
    <li>Stateful components can use react life cycle hooks</li>
    <li>In stateful components it good to use the this instance</li></ol></h3>
    <h3>Stateless component:</h3>
    <h3><ol><li>A component that has no internal state management in it.</li>
    <li>A component that has no internal state management in it.</li>
    <li>Function components are simply functions that receive the props and return the JSX code.</li>
    <li>Stateless components can not use the react life cycle hooks</li>
    <li>Here need not to use this instance, they just receive the props as an argument</li></ol></h3>

    <h2>Ans- We can switch from one component to another component by the means of following:</h2>

    <h2>2. Conditional rendering i.e, by using ternary operators</h2>
